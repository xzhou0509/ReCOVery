## Installation    

###  Requirements:

 All the scripts are written in python and requires `python 3.6 +` to run.
 
 Twitter data is gathered using Twitter Developer account and API keys. The twitter developer account can be created at
 [https://developer.twitter.com/en]. Once the account is created, you can create the app. On successful creation of the app, the keys will be  available in the `keys and tokens` section of the app.
 
 To start using twitter APIs, add the keys to the `get_twitter_data.py` and run function set_creds(). This will add keys to the `code/credentials/api-credentials.yaml` file.
 
 Twitter data is gathered using premium search APIs.
 
 `code/collect_articles.ipynb` - The code to collect news articles from the news url.
